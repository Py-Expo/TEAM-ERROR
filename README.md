# Travel Alert System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust travel alert system to address the issues encountered in previous incidents. Leveraging Python, this system utilizes SMTP for email communication, `emails` library for email composition and formatting, `pandas` for data processing, and `openpyxl` for working with Excel files. The system will provide timely alerts and notifications to users, enhancing safety and reliability during travel.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/travel_alert_system.git](https://github.com/Py-Expo/TEAM-ERROR.git)
    ```

2. **Install required Python modules with specific versions:**
    ```bash
    pip install smtp==3.13.3 emails==0.6 pandas==2.2.1 openpyxl
    ```

## Usage

1. **Configure email settings:**

    Update the configuration file (`config.py`) with SMTP server details and email credentials. Ensure that the email settings are correctly configured for seamless communication.

2. **Prepare data:**

    If necessary, preprocess and organize data in formats compatible with the system. For `pandas` data processing, ensure data is structured appropriately for analysis and alert generation.

3. **Run the system:**

    Execute the main Python script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. **Interact with the system:**

    Follow the prompts or interface provided by the system to receive alerts, notifications, or updates regarding travel-related incidents.

## File Structure

- `main.py`: Primary Python script containing the core functionality of the travel alert system.
- `config.py`: Configuration file holding SMTP server details, email credentials, and other settings.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing required Python modules along with their specific versions.
- Other files: Additional scripts, data files, or resources pertinent to the project.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `smtp` (version 3.13.3): Simple Mail Transfer Protocol library for email communication.
- `emails` (version 0.6): Library for composing and formatting emails.
- `pandas` (version 2.2.1): Data manipulation library for processing travel-related data.
- `openpyxl`: Library for working with Excel files, facilitating data handling and analysis.
